# HARNESSING-GENETIC-ALGORITHMS-TO-OPTIMIZE-SCHEDULING-CHALLENGES-IN-WORKFORCE-MANAGEMENT
This Python implementation utilizes a Genetic Algorithm to optimize employee scheduling, considering factors like shift assignments, employee preferences (gender diversity), and workload balance.

Key Features:

Genetic Algorithm: Employs evolutionary principles for efficient schedule generation.
Constraint Handling: Incorporates constraints such as:
No double shifts for individual employees on the same day.
Balanced workload distribution across employees.
Gender diversity requirement in each shift.
Customizable Parameters: Allows for adjustments to population size, generations, mutation rate, and elite size.
Visualization: Includes a basic visualization of the shift distribution for the optimized schedule.
This project provides a foundation for developing more sophisticated workforce scheduling solutions, adaptable to various business needs and constraints.
